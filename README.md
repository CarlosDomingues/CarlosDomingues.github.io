This is my personal webpage, published on [carlo.sh](https://carlo.sh)

## Building

This page can be built in any system that has a POSIX compliant shell and `pandoc`.

## Developing

My stack:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Visual Studio Code's [innerHTML Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicolasparada.innerhtml) extension. This is handy as this webpage makes heavy use of Custom Elements, so syntax highlighting for innerHTML template literals becomes a necessity.
- Visual Studio Code's [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension. This is useful to preview Markdown content.
